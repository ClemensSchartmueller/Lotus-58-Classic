# How do I flash nanoBoot to my Pro Micro controllers?

**Please note that this does NOT apply to RP2040 based controllers at all!**

## Flash the bootloader with an external programmer
Download the `nanoBoot-bootloader.hex` file and flash it using your choice of software/hardware.

#### Required fuse settings:
- lfuse memory = 0xFF or 0x7F (CKDIV8=1 or 0, 16CK+65ms)
- hfuse memory = 0xD6 (EESAVE=0, BOOTRST=0)
- efuse memory = 0xC7 (=0xF7, No BOD)

#### Example of fuse command
-U lfuse:w:0x7F:m -U hfuse:w:0xD6:m -U efuse:w:0xC7:m

## Using a pair of Pro Micro controllers as ISP programmers to flash the bootloader to both.
**This requires no external hardware, besides a few wires, and a little patience and time.** This way, you can easily and cheaply use the classic Atmega32u4 Pro Micro controllers a while longer, with either a full featured QMK keymap, or Vial if you accept some limitations in what features will fit.

1. Install Arduino IDE 1.8.19 and Pro Micro support:
  - Go to Files -> Preferences;
  - Paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards/master/IDE_Board_Manager/package_sparkfun_index.json` into "Additional Boards Manager URLs", press OK;
  - Go to Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager;
  - Search for `SparkFun AVR Boards`, install that, close the dialog window.
2. Burn the ArduinoISP sketch (through the normal USB connection):
  - Connect one of your two Pro Micros (we will call it `A` from now on);
  - In Arduino IDE, go to Tools -> Board -> SparkFun AVR Boards -> SparkFun Pro Micro;
  - As Processor choose the 5V 16MHz version;
  - As Port choose whatever the Arduino IDE gives you as an option (If you have more than 1 serial device connected, figure out which port is your Pro Micro by plugging and unplugging it)
  - In Arduino IDE, go to File -> Examples -> ArduinoISP -> ArduinoISP;
  - Hit Upload (either the arrow to the right next to the checkmark, or in Sketch -> Upload);
  - Close the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the two Pro Micros:
  - Disconnect the Pro Micro `A` from the computer, get 6 jumper wires;
  - Connect the GND pin to GND pin, VCC to VCC, 15 to 15, 14 to 14, 16 to 16;
  - PAY ATTENTION: Connect the pin 10 of the Pro Micro `A`, to RST of the Pro Micro `B`;
  - Plug the Pro Micro `A` back into the computer.
4. Burn the supplied `nanoBoot-bootloader.hex` to the Pro Micro `B` (using `AÂ´ as the ISP):
  - Now we will use `avrdude` included in the Arduino as a standalone executable (These instructions assume you use a terminal for your OS);
  - In the terminal go to the location where you downloaded the supplied `nanoBoot_ArduinoISP.hex` (use the `cd` command to jump between directories, `ls` (MacOS/Linux) or `dir` (Windows) displays content)
  - Run this command: `avrdude -c stk500v1 -p atmega32u4 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -b 19200 -U flash:w:nanoBoot-ArduinoISP.hex:i -U lfuse:w:0x7F:m -U hfuse:w:0xD6:m -U efuse:w:0xC7:m`  **WARNING: This command sets fuses on the board and wrong values of the fuses can brick the board beyond repair. This is done at your own responsibility!!** *Note: you might need to change the serial port given after -P from what is shown here, it should be the same you used when uploading the sketch through Arduino IDE.*
  - This flashes the same ArduinoISP sketch, but with the nanoBoot bootloader already included.
5. Burn the nanoBoot bootloader to the Pro Micro `A`:
  - Disconnect the Pro Micro `A` from the computer;
  - Swap the connections between the Pro Micros, since you will now swap the roles of the Pro Micros - Connect Pro Micro `A`'s RST to Pro Micro `B`'s pin 10;
  - Connect the Pro Micro `B` to the computer;
  - Run the same command as in step 4 (**the same warning applies**);
  - Congratulations! Now you have two Pro Micros with nanoBoot bootloaders!
6. Flash the Lotus58 firmware either from QMK Configurator, or using an already compiled binary
7. Test and celebrate!
