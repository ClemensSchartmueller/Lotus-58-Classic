Change Log Lotus 58 Glow USB-C

- v1.30 - Initial release
   - This version adds an USB-C link between hands instead of the TRRS link. This allows hot-plugging the link without damage.
   - NO support for wirless builds (battery/power switch) as the USB-C link isn't suitable for this.
- v1.33 - Intermediary release
  - Minor tweaks to the ESD protection circuit
  - The RGB circuit now allows ALL RGB to be soldered in place, and switches the powerline instead of the data line as previously.
  - ALL RGB uses SK6812 mini-e
  - Reset switch and slide switch is moved for better 3D printed cases. 
- v1.40 - Second major release
  - Moved serial data to D+/- for better cable compatibility.
  - Added solder jumpers for RGB selection without switch
- v1.41 - Intermediary release
  - Corrected minor silkscreen inconsistencies.
